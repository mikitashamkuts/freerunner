/**
 * Detailed Explanation:
 *
 * - `project`: This object contains platform-specific configurations for the React Native project.
 *   - `ios`: An empty object that can be used to specify iOS-specific linking configurations.
 *   - `android`: An empty object that can be used to specify Android-specific linking configurations.
 *
 * - `assets`: This array specifies the paths to the asset directories that should be linked to the native projects.
 *   - `./assets/fonts`: This path points to the directory where custom fonts are stored.
 *     By including this path, the `react-native link` command will ensure these fonts are available in the iOS and Android projects.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Run `react-native link` to automatically link the assets defined in this configuration file.
 * - This setup is essential for including custom fonts in your React Native application, ensuring they are properly bundled and accessible in both iOS and Android builds.
 *
 * Example of Customization:
 * - If you have additional assets like images or sounds, you can include their paths in the `assets` array.
 * - If specific configurations are needed for iOS or Android projects, you can add them to the respective objects under the `project` key.
 *
 * This configuration helps maintain a clean and organized approach to managing assets in a React Native project,
 * ensuring consistency and ease of setup across different environments and platforms.
