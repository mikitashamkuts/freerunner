/**
 * Detailed Explanation:
 *
 * - `import {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';`
 *   - AppRegistry is the JS entry point to running all React Native apps.
 *   - AppRegistry is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the app and registering the root component.
 *
 * - `import App from './App';`
 *   - This imports the main application component, which is defined in the App.js file.
 *   - This component serves as the root component of the application.
 *
 * - `import './wdyr';`
 *   - This imports the Why Did You Render (wdyr) configuration.
 *   - wdyr is a library that helps track unnecessary re-renders in React applications.
 *   - Including this in the import ensures it runs when the app starts.
 *
 * - `import {name as appName} from './app.json';`
 *   - This imports the application name from the app.json file.
 *   - The `appName` is used to register the application with the AppRegistry.
 *
 * - `AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);`
 *   - This function call registers the main application component with the AppRegistry.
 *   - The first argument is the application name (appName) and the second argument is a function that returns the main App component.
 *   - This registration is necessary for the app to start and render the root component.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - This file serves as the entry point for the React Native application.
 * - It sets up the main application component and registers it with the AppRegistry.
 * - When the app is launched, React Native will look for this registration and start the application.
